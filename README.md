# Radishes in Outerspace

Growing radishes in Mars? Plants react to gravitropism? 

Using varying centripetal force as artificial g-force, this web app plots in real-time some critical parameters of each radish tested against different empirical values of g: soil moisture, internal temperature, and ambient lighting. The experiment along with the data is visualized with plot.ly to verify the hypothesis that in conditions with stronger gravity we can expect to observe larger radishes.
